# Classic Package
The Classic Package is a separate package of Keen that does not require any build tools(e.g: gulp), css processors(e.g: sass) and package managers(e.g: npm, yarn).
With the Classic Package you will get all features that Keen offers and code with the old style coding approach, that is, edit css and js code and reload page to see the result.
